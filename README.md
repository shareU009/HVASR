## Abstract

In recent years, the rapid growth of 360-degree videos has been attributed to their ability to provide immersive experiences. However, 360-degree videos significantly increase the demand for bandwidth, requiring roughly four to ten
times more bandwidth compared to traditional videos, making it a significant challenge to maintain high-quality video in environments with wireless networks or limited bandwidth. A trend has emerged of using the clientâ€™s computation power and deep neural networks to enhance video quality and reduce bandwidth requirements in modern video delivery systems. These methods divide a video into chunks and train each chunk with a super-resolution model, streaming low-resolution video chunks along with their corresponding super-resolution models to the client. They improve video quality and transmission efficiency on conventional videos, but for 360-degree videos, require more computational resources, limiting widespread deployment. This paper proposes a novel method called HVASR for 360-degree video, leveraging viewport information for more precise video partitioning and minimizing model training costs and bandwidth requirements. HVASR also integrates a viewport-aware training method to further improve performance and reduce computational costs. Experimental results show that HVASR increases average utility by 12.46% to 40.89% across various scenes.
